description: "The Canterbury Tales (Middle English: Tales of Caunterbury) is a collection\
  \ of 24 stories that runs to over 17,000 lines written in Middle English by Geoffrey\
  \ Chaucer. In 1386 Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of Peace and\
  \ then three years later in 1389 Clerk of the King's work. It was during these years\
  \ that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, The Canterbury Tales. The\
  \ tales (mostly written in verse, although some are in prose) are presented as part\
  \ of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a\
  \ journey from London to Canterbury in order to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas\
  \ Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the\
  \ Tabard Inn at Southwark on their return.\nAfter a long list of works written earlier\
  \ in his career, including Troilus and Criseyde, House of Fame, and Parliament of\
  \ Fowls, The Canterbury Tales is near-unanimously seen as Chaucer's magnum opus.\
  \ He uses the tales and the descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and\
  \ critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church.\
  \ Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without\
  \ precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer\
  \ a variety of insights into the customs and practices of the time. Often, such\
  \ insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements to people in the 14th\
  \ century. For example, although a variety of social classes are represented in\
  \ these stories and all pilgrims on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they\
  \ are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection\
  \ resembles The Decameron, which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic\
  \ mission to Italy in 1372.\nIt is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution\
  \ The Canterbury Tales made to English literature was in popularizing the literary\
  \ use of the vernacular, English, rather than French, Italian or Latin. English\
  \ had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time,\
  \ and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—John Gower, William Langland, the Pearl\
  \ Poet, and Julian of Norwich—also wrote major literary works in English. It is\
  \ unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend as opposed\
  \ to simply being part of it.\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many\
  \ of his poems, the intended audience of The Canterbury Tales is more difficult\
  \ to determine. Chaucer was a courtier, leading some to believe that he was mainly\
  \ a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility.\nThe Canterbury Tales were far\
  \ from complete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the General Prologue, some thirty\
  \ pilgrims are introduced. Chaucer's intention was to write two stories from the\
  \ perspective of each pilgrim on the way to and from their ultimate destination,\
  \ St. Thomas Becket's shrine. Although perhaps incomplete, The Canterbury Tales\
  \ is revered as one of the most important works in English literature. Not only\
  \ do readers from all time frames find it entertaining, but also it is a work that\
  \ is open to a range of interpretations.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
